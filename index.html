        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Zoning regulations play a critical role in shaping housing supply and
          affordability. In Massachusetts, exclusionary zoning practices—such as
          single-family mandates—have constrained housing production and
          exacerbated inequities. The Affordable Homes Act (2024) calls for
          200,000 new housing units by 2030, yet outdated zoning codes remain a
          significant barrier. This exploratory analysis investigates zoning
          patterns, compliance discrepancies, and policy impacts across Metro
          Boston municipalities, leveraging spatial and demographic data. The
          analysis focuses on three key research questions:

        <h2>Discoveries &amp; Insights</h2>

        <!-- Data Overview -->
        <section>
          <h3>Phase 1: Data Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The dataset used—<code>housing_sf_other_w_census</code>—combines
            information from the MAPC Zoning Atlas with U.S. Census (2010) and
            American Community Survey (2014–2018) demographic data. It
            aggregates zoning, household income, and population statistics
            across municipalities in Metro Boston, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Zoning Information:</strong> %_single_family,
              only_single_family
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Demographics:</strong> pop, nhwhi, male, female, etc.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Household Structure:</strong> hh, nfhh1, fhh</li>
            <li><strong>Income Data:</strong> in200o, i100125, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The first issue is there are two rows for some municipalities in
            this dataset due to zoning type (only_single_family = 1 or 0). Some
            municipalities have zero population due to data structure issues. If
            a municipality has two rows, the dataset splits population and
            income data by zoning type, requiring aggregation or filtering based
            on analysis needs.
          </p>

          <figure>
            <img
              src="images/figure1.png"
              alt="Dark orange municipalities in the dataset"
            />
            <figcaption>
              Municipalities shown in dark orange have two rows in the
              dataset—one for <em>only_single_family</em> = 1 and one for
              <em>only_single_family</em> = 0—indicating a mix of zoning types.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            The second issue is that Population is from 2010 (blocks), while
            income is from 2014–2018(block groups). As the block groups are more
            general than zoning, when certain zoning areas are too small, their
            income values may be lost because they cannot be aggregated. The
            total households from income data may be different from the
            households from population data as they come from different years.
            The third thing worth noticing is that %_single_family aggregates
            zoning at the municipal level, masking neighborhood-level
            variations. That means this analysis will focus on the municipal
            level.

        <h3>Phase 2: Question-Driven Analysis</h3>

        <!-- Question 1 -->
        <h4>
          Question 1: What is the relationship between single-family zoning and
          demographic factors such as race?
        </h4>
        <p>
          This question is directly informed by prior studies suggesting that
          single-family zoning can exclude low-income and non-white residents. I
          mapped out the percentage of single-family zoning in each municipality
          and compared it to the proportion of Non-Hispanic White residents.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/figure2.png"

          <figcaption>

        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Findings:</strong> Municipalities like Bolton, Dover, Duxbury,
          Hanover, Hopkinton, Nahant, and Wenham each have 100% single-family
          zoning. Meanwhile, Boston, Somerville, and Cambridge hover at or near
          0%, reflecting denser urban settings.
        </p>

        <p>
          In order to calculate percentage of Non Non-Hispanic White percentage,
          I first plotted the population distributions. There are several
          municipalities having 0 population, I excluded them for the rest of
          analysis under the first question.
        </p>

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          There is no strong correlation overall, but Randolph stands out with
          97.8% single-family zoning and only 33.26% Non-Hispanic White
          residents. This suggests other factors—historical migration patterns,
          housing costs, or local policies—also shape the racial composition in
          ways not captured by zoning alone.
        </p>

        <!-- Question 2 -->
        <h4>
          Question 2: How do household structures and income levels differ
          between single-family and mixed-use zones?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Motivated by the idea that exclusionary zoning can perpetuate
          socio-economic disparities, I compared household incomes and family
          vs. non-family household structures in single-family
          (only_single_family = 1) vs. mixed-use (only_single_family = 0) zones.

          I first classify households by income groups: Low-income - households
          Under $30k; High-income - households Above $200,000 annual incom;
          Others classified as mid-income households.

        <p>
          <strong>Findings:</strong> High-Income Households (Top Panel) Both
          zoning types show a wide range of high-income household percentages,
          with some municipalities exceeding 60%. The median percentage of
          high-income households appears slightly higher in single-family zones
          (1) compared to mixed-use zones (0). Low-income households are present
          in both zoning categories. A few municipalities in mixed-use zones (0)
          have outliers with high percentages of low-income households,
          suggesting affordable housing clusters in multi-family zones.

        <p>
          <strong>Findings:</strong> High-income households appear in both
          zones, but the median high-income percentage is slightly higher in
          single-family areas.
        </p>
        Finially, I compared family vs. non-family households in single-family
        and mixed-use zones to see if zoning patterns influence household
        structures.

          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Findings:</strong> Family households show little variation
          across zoning types. Non-family households are slightly more prevalent
          in mixed-use zones: Median (multi-family zones): 13.2%; Median
          (single-family zones): 12.0% While single-family zoning does not
          significantly impact family household prevalence, it slightly limits
          the presence of non-family households (e.g., singles, roommates).

        <!-- Question 3 -->
        <h4>
          Question 3: Do MBTA-designated municipalities exhibit lower
          single-family zoning percentages and greater housing diversity?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The MBTA Communities Act aims to promote transit-oriented development
          by encouraging diverse housing near transit lines. We compared
          single-family zoning in MBTA municipalities vs. non-MBTA ones to see
          if this policy influences broader housing patterns.

        </figure>
        <p>
          <strong>Findings:</strong> MBTA Communities have about 50%
          single-family zoning on average, compared to 55% elsewhere. The
          difference is modest, partly because only four non-MBTA municipalities
          appear in this dataset. While the MBTA Communities Act may facilitate
          incremental zoning reforms, it has yet to yield a marked shift away
          from single-family zoning in many areas.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- Summary & Recommendations -->
      <section>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Single-family zoning is slightly more associated with high-income
          households than multi-family zoning. Multi-family or mixed-use zoning
          has a slightly higher share of low-income households, likely due to a
          more diverse housing stock, including apartments and rental units.
        </p>
        <p>
          The presence of outliers suggests that zoning alone does not fully
          determine income distribution—other factors such as housing policies,
          affordability programs, and geographic location play a role.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although MBTA zoning reforms have had limited impact on reducing
          single-family zoning, they provide a framework for encouraging housing
          diversity. To promote inclusive and affordable communities,
          policymakers should expand multi-family zoning in high-income
          municipalities, strengthen MBTA zoning mandates, and enhance
          affordable housing incentives to counteract exclusionary zoning
          practices.
