      <h2>Proposition:</h2>
      <h4>
        As greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the world is experiencing
        an increase in climate-related disasters. However, the impact is not
        felt equally—emerging economies, which emit more greenhouse gases,
        exhibit a stronger correlation between rising emissions and disaster
        frequency over time, making them more vulnerable to climate risks.

          The first visualization demonstrates a strong correlation between
          total GHG emissions and the frequency of climate-related disasters in
          emerging economies. As emissions increase, disaster occurrences also
          rise, particularly after 2012. The stacked bar chart clearly shows
          that extreme weather events—such as storms, floods, and wildfires—are
          more frequent in regions with higher emissions. In contrast, advanced
          economies display a weaker correlation, with a more gradual increase
          in disasters despite stable or slower emission growth. This suggests
          that higher emissions in emerging economies contribute to greater
          climate risks, reinforcing the claim that rising emissions drive
          disaster frequency.

            GHG Emissions and Climate-Related Disasters per Capita (2010–2022)

        </figure>
        <p>
          The assumption that emerging economies contribute more to
          climate-related disasters due to higher emissions is challenged by the
          fact that advanced economies actually emit more greenhouse gases per
          capita. While emerging economies have higher total emissions due to
          their larger populations and industrial growth, advanced economies
          continue to have significantly higher per capita emissions, meaning
          that each individual in these countries contributes more to global
          greenhouse gas levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second visualization highlights this contrast by normalizing
          emissions per million population, revealing that advanced economies
          have historically emitted more per person while still experiencing
          climate disasters at a high rate. This suggests that total emissions
          alone are not the primary driver of disaster frequency, and instead,
          factors such as urbanization, climate resilience policies, and
          geographic vulnerabilities play a larger role in determining disaster
          frequency.

        <h2>Data Cleaning and Transformation</h2>
        <p>
          The raw data was sourced from the
          <a href="https://climatedata.imf.org/">IMF Climate Data Portal</a> and
          includes two datasets:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Annual Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Air Emissions Accounts:</strong>
            Measures annual greenhouse gas emissions (in million metric tons of
            CO₂ equivalent) from 2010 to 2022, classified by economic groups
            (Advanced Economies and Emerging and Developing Economies).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Climate-related Disasters Frequency:</strong> Tracks the
            frequency of climate-related disasters by country from 1980 to 2024,
            sourced from the EM-DAT Emergency Events Database. Disaster types
            include storms, floods, wildfires, droughts, and extreme
            temperatures.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h3>
        <p>
          To ensure consistency and accuracy, the following steps were taken:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Filtering Relevant Data:</strong> Retained only data from
            2010–2022 for emissions and 1980–2024 for disasters. Countries were
            grouped into Advanced Economies and Emerging and Developing
            Economies based on IMF classifications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Standardizing Units:</strong> Ensured all emissions data was
            in million metric tons of CO₂ equivalent and disaster occurrences
            were counted consistently.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Data Reshaping:</strong> Converted both datasets into long
            format, where each row represents a combination of
            <em
              >Region, Year, Emissions, Disaster Type, and Disaster
              Frequency</em
            >.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Transformation and Aggregation</h3>
        <p>
          After cleaning, data transformation was performed to prepare for
          visualization:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Summing Emissions by Region and Year:</strong> Aggregated
            emissions for each economic group to analyze trends over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Grouping Disaster Occurrences:</strong> Disaster frequency
            was summed for each region and year to compare trends with
            emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Normalizing Disaster Frequency:</strong> An additional
            transformation was performed to calculate
            <em>disaster frequency per million population</em>, ensuring a fair
            comparison between regions with different population sizes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Merging the Two Datasets:</strong> Joined emissions and
            disaster frequency data on <em>Region</em> and <em>Year</em>,
            enabling a direct comparison of emissions and climate disasters.
          </li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Going through the design process for both visualizations, I realized
          just how much data transformations and visual choices shape people’s
          interpretations. Cleaning and organizing the data—grouping emissions
          and disasters by region and year—was relatively straightforward,
          making it easier to compare trends. However, representing the
          relationship between emissions and disasters proved more challenging.
          There was a fine line between making the visuals persuasive and
          maintaining ethical visualization practices. One of the toughest
          decisions was whether to use absolute emissions or normalize them per
          capita. The first approach highlighted a strong correlation between
          emissions and disaster frequency, while the second shifted the focus
          to per capita emissions, challenging that assumption. This contrast
          reinforced how valid but different transformations can lead to vastly
          different interpretations.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project reshaped my understanding of ethical data visualization.
          It’s not just about accuracy but also about ensuring data is presented
          transparently, without misleading the audience through selective
          framing or deceptive scaling. There’s a crucial distinction between
          enhancing clarity and manipulating data to push a specific narrative.
          For instance, using a dual-axis plot to highlight relationships can be
          effective, but exaggerating trends by tweaking scales crosses an
          ethical boundary. Similarly, filtering data can improve readability,
          but omitting key patterns to fit a particular message is misleading.
          Ultimately, ethical visualization should provide a fair, truthful
          representation of data, empowering viewers to draw their own informed
          conclusions rather than subtly steering them toward a biased
          perspective.
