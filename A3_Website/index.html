        <p>Insights about the data/visualization:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            New cases’ Peak in Early 2022: The widest section of the red shaded
            area appears in January 2022, indicating a record-breaking surge in
            COVID-19 cases.
          </li>
          <li>
            Peaks appear around winter (January–February) in both 2021 and 2022,
            aligning with seasonal surges.
          </li>
          <li>
            General increasing patterns over years: each successive year shows
            an increase in peak case numbers, with 2022 being the highest,
            followed by 2021, and 2020 having the smallest peaks.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Design Critique:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The spiral timeline is a visually striking but unconventional way to
            present COVID-19 case trends. The red shaded area effectively
            highlights the 7-day average, showing fluctuations in daily case
            numbers. However, the format makes it difficult to compare exact
            case counts across different years, as there is no numerical scale
            to provide precise values.
          </li>
          <li>
            Another drawback is the difficulty in tracking seasonal trends and
            daily fluctuations. The spiral layout forces readers to follow time
            in a circular pattern, which may not be intuitive, especially for
            those unfamiliar with this format.
          </li>
          <li>
            Additionally, the design gives the impression that case numbers
            exploded in early 2022, but it is hard to directly compare this with
            the peaks from January to February 2021. If the spiral continues
            expanding, future peaks might either overlap or create too much
            empty space, making it tricky to balance clarity and spacing. The
            choice of the spiral’s radius is therefore crucial in maintaining
            readability while ensuring an accurate representation of trends.

        <h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

        <p>
          Below are three sketches of potential redesigns for the COVID-19 case
          visualization. I really like the circular layout of the original
          visualization, as it is visually engaging and unique. However, I
          believe that the design can be improved to better convey the data
          trends and make it easier for readers to interpret the information.
        </p>

            graphs with a circular layout to compare cases across years.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 1:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Maintains a radial structure for continuity while improving
            visibility of case differences between years.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stacked bars allow for direct comparison of case counts across
            different years, with each segment representing a specific year
            color-coded.
          </li>
          <li>It shows a better seasonal trend than the original graphs.</li>
        </ul>

            cases across 2020-2022, color-coded by year.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 2:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            I change to a logarithmic scale to better show the distribution of
            cases. The relavant location to the core of the circle is the
            logarithm of the case number.
          </li>
          <li>
            Color-coding different years allows for easy comparison of case
            patterns across 2020, 2021, and 2022.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is one of the most efficient design to show the seasonal and
            yearly trend of new cases. However, it simplifies the actual case
            numbers in this presentation.
          </li>

        <p>Design Rationale for Sketch 3:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Uses a continuous line graph to show fluctuations in COVID-19 cases,
            making trends over time more readable.
          </li>
          <li>
            This line graph allows for better comparison between years by
            aligning on a same radial axis.
          </li>
          <li>
            Lines are more intuitive than heatmap or bar in terms of compare the
            magnitude of outbreaks across years.

        <h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

        <p>
          In redesigning the COVID-19 case visualization, I aimed to retain the
          engaging radial format while improving interpretability and clarity.
          The primary issue with the original spiral design was its difficulty
          in comparing data across years, as the case counts were not explicitly
          labeled and seasonal trends were hard to discern. To address these
          concerns, I chose a circular stacked barplot as the final design,
          which maintains the visual appeal of the radial format but enhances
          readability. The stacked bars allow for direct year-over-year
          comparison, making it easier to see how case numbers evolved over
          time. I also ensured that the spacing and scaling of the bars were
          carefully adjusted to avoid excessive overlap while still maintaining
          a compact layout. The circular layout preserves the seasonal
          storytelling aspect of the data while providing a clearer view of how
          case trends shift annually.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of visual encodings, I used color to differentiate years,
          ensuring that each period is distinguishable while maintaining visual
          continuity. The bar lengths represent case counts, scaled
          appropriately to emphasize peaks and seasonal trends without
          overwhelming the viewer with excessive detail. A logarithmic
          transformation was considered but ultimately not used, as the focus
          was on absolute case magnitude rather than proportional change.
          Compared to the original spiral, the circular stacked barplot allows
          for better quantitative comparisons while preserving the engaging
          structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          The final visualization aims to effectively communicate the seasonal
          patterns and year-over-year differences in COVID-19 cases in the U.S.
          from 2020 to 2022. By using a circular stacked barplot, I sought to
          emphasize the recurring winter peaks while providing a more structured
          comparison of different years. The stacked format enables direct
          year-over-year analysis, making it easier to identify trends like the
          increasing peak case counts over time. This design maintains the
          engaging radial structure of the original but enhances readability,
          ensuring that both the seasonal fluctuations and long-term growth of
          cases remain evident. The choice of a categorical color scheme for
          different years aids in distinguishing trends while ensuring that each
          year’s data remains visually coherent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reflecting on the redesign process, I found that the critique phase
          helped uncover key trade-offs in visualization design. While my final
          design improves comparability and numerical clarity, it does sacrifice
          some of the fluidity of the spiral format, which effectively conveyed
          the cyclical nature of outbreaks. Additionally, while my visualization
          provides a clearer structure, fine-grained day-to-day variations are
          less prominent than in a line-based graph. This iterative process
          reinforced the balance between aesthetics and data precision—an
          ongoing challenge in designing effective visualizations.
